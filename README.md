# Automated-seed-sowing-machine-using-Arduino
This project is an automated seed sowing machine that can be controlled using an Arduino microcontroller. The machine is designed to help farmers sow seeds efficiently and accurately, reducing the amount of time and labor required for planting.

The seed sowing machine uses a stepper motor to control the rotation of a disc that holds the seeds. The seeds are dispensed through a small opening in the disc and are guided into the soil using a funnel. The machine is controlled using an Arduino board, which can be programmed to control the speed and duration of the motor, as well as the amount of seeds dispensed.

# Components
To build this project, you will need the following components:

Arduino Board (Uno or Nano)
Stepper Motor
L293D Motor Driver
9V Battery
Funnel
Disc
Wooden base
Screws and nuts
Jumper Wires
 
# Installation and Usage
Connect the components as shown in the circuit diagram.
Connect the Arduino board to your computer and upload the code.
Fill the disc with seeds and place it on the machine.
Power the machine using a 9V battery.
Adjust the speed and duration of the motor using the code to suit your requirements.
Place the funnel on the soil and turn on the machine to start seeding.
# Code
The code for the seed sowing machine is available in the code.ino file.

# Conclusion
This automated seed sowing machine can be a useful tool for farmers looking to increase efficiency and accuracy in their planting process. By using an Arduino microcontroller to control the machine, the speed and duration of the motor can be adjusted to suit the specific requirements of each crop. With some adjustments, this machine can be scaled up to cover larger fields and can even be used for other purposes such as fertilizing or spraying.
